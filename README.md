##Grazioso Salvare/Global Rain.
The required functionality of this project will involve working with existing data from the animal shelter. This will give Grazioso Salvare persons the ability to identify and categorize data.  The application will also feature a client facing dashboard. Persons may access the database from there. The users can interact with the preexisting data from the animal shelter database categorized by the rescue type of the animal. The code implemented in this documentation is for CRUD operations (create, read, update, repeat) functionality.  Which allows users to interact through filtering options with database collections data. 
Tools Used
The tools used for this application were very straight forward. Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Linux os, terminal commands, import commands used inside python files, MongoDB for the database, and a spreadsheet for dataset. MongoDB was used for this project because of its scalability along with python’s flexibility. Of course, there are a many other reasons to choose these technologies such as pymongo’s ease of use or the number of libraries provided. I am simply naming a couple. Python can handle a verbose amount of data with a few lines of code for starters. Handling large amount of data in real time is better managed through MongoDB. The scalability is what gives the program more modularity.
Be sure to explain the Dash framework that provides the view and controller structure for the web application.


##Steps Taken
To begin, we will start by opening the virtual machine via Apport. This can be accessed through Brightspace. Next, we will open the Jupyter Notebooks application within the Linux operating system.  We will either create a new folder or use an existing folder to place the file of the prewritten code. Within the folder, we will create the ipynb file responsible for implementing and compiling our code. The source code has been made available via module four assignment information via Brightspace. Since the virtual machine will not allow me as a mac user to copy and paste the code directly into the IDE. I needed to copy the code into a text file on MY personal machine, upload that file into apporto through the desktop. On the upper left-hand corner of the screen there is a button to upload files anywhere from your personal machine. Then, copy and paste the code into the IDE and save. 
Challenges
The challenges I faced believe it or not was getting the module to connect to the other files so the program will run properly. This was the biggest issues because this was the only error message I would get after changing the names of files and such. I am still having difficulties getting the program to run properly in this regard.
