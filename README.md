## Grazioso Salvare/Global Rain.
The required functionality of this project will involve working with existing data from the animal shelter CSV file. This will give Grazioso Salvare employees the ability to identify and categorize data, specifically dog breeds. The application will also feature a client facing dashboard. Affiliates of Grazioso Salvare/Global Rain may access the database from via database queries. The users can interact with the preexisting data from the animal shelter database categorized by the rescue type of the animal (breed). The code implemented in this documentation is for CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) functionality.  Which allows users to interact through filtering options with database collections data. 

## Tools Used
The tools used for this application were Python, Jupyter Notebooks, CLI commands, Plotly Dash, import commands used inside python files, MongoDB for the database, and a spreadsheet for dataset. MongoDB was used for this project because of its scalability along with python’s flexibility and ease of use. Of course, there are a many other reasons to choose these technologies such as pymongo’s ease of use or the number of libraries provided. Python can handle a verbose amount of data with a few lines of code. Handling large amount of data in real time is better managed through MongoDB. The scalability is what gives the program more modularity.


## Steps Taken
To begin, we will start by opening the virtual machine via Apporto. This can be accessed through Brightspace. Or, within the user's pesonal machine running Linux OS. Next, open Jupyter Notebooks. Create a new folder or use an existing folder to place the file of the prewritten code. Within the folder, we will create the ipynb file responsible for implementing and compiling our code. The source code has been made available from module four assignment information via Brightspace through Southern New Hampshire University. In some instances, the virtual machine will not allow users who use mac to copy and paste the code directly into the IDE. You may copy the code into a text file on your personal machine, upload that file into apporto through the desktop. On the upper left-hand corner of the screen on the desktop in the virtual machine, there is a button to upload files anywhere from your personal machine. Copy and paste the code into the IDE and save your work.
